# Textual_data_Analysis_with_different_RNN_Architectures
The project is about  Sentiment Analysis  that shows output on  whether the provided text is positive or negative. Here I have implemented RNN, LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM and Bidirectional GRU for analyzing the sequential textual data for Sentiment Classification.  It's an Introductory &amp; comparative analysis on accuracy results among different RNN architectures, that shows performances of different models.    
Data has been fetched from http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ , the largest movie review dataset.
